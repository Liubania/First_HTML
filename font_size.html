    <h3>The area around Alicante has been inhabited for over 7000 years.</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><h4>The first tribes of hunter-gatherers moved down gradually from Central Europe between 5000 and 3000 BC.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Some of the earliest settlements were made on the slopes of Mount Benacantil.</h4>
    </li>
    <li> <h4>By 1000 BC Greek and Phoenician traders had begun to visit the eastern coast of Spain, establishing small trading ports and introducing the native Iberian tribes to the alphabet, iron, and the pottery wheel.</h4>
    </li>
    <li> <h4>The Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca established the fortified settlement of Akra Leuké, meaning "White Mountain" or "White Point", in the mid-230s BC, which is generally presumed to have been on the site of modern Alicante.</h4>

    <h3>Geography</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><h4> Alicante is located in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Some orographic features rise over the largely flat terrain where the city is built on including the Cabo de la Huerta, the Serra Grossa, the Tosal and the Benacantil hills.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Located in an arid territory, Alicante lacks any meaningful permanent water stream.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>There are however several stream beds correspondent to intermittent ramblas.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>There was a swamp area in the northeast of the municipality, l'Albufereta, yet it was dried up in 1928.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The municipality has two exclaves in the mainland: Monnegre (between the municipalities of San Vicente del Raspeig, Mutxamel, Busot and Jijona), and Cabeçó d'Or; the latter comprises part of the namesake Cabeçó d'Or mountain (including the summit, 1209 metres above sea level).</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The small island of Tabarca, 8 nautical miles to the south of the city, also belongs to the municipality.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The foot of the main staircase of the City Hall Building (Ayuntamiento) is the zero point (cota cero), used as the point of reference for measuring the height above or below sea level of any point in Spain, due to the marginal tidal variations of the Mediterranean sea at Alicante.</h4>
    </li>

    <h3>Economy </h3>
    <ul>
    <li><h4>Until the global recession which started in 2008, Alicante was one of the fastest-growing cities in Spain.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The boom depended partly on tourism directed to the beaches of the Costa Blanca and particularly on the second residence-construction boom which started in the 1960s and revived again by the late 1990s.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Services and public administration also play a major role in the city's economy.</h4>
    </li> 
    <li><h4>The construction boom has raised many environmental concerns and both the local autonomous government and city council are under scrutiny by the European Union.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The construction surge was the subject of hot debates among politicians and citizens alike.</h4>
    </li> 
    <li><h4> The latest of many public battles concerns the plans of the Port Authority of Alicante to construct an industrial estate on reclaimed land in front of the city's coastal strip, in breach of local, national, and European regulations.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>See Port of Alicante for details.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4> Ciudad de la Luz. The city serves as the headquarters of the European Union Intellectual Property Office and a sizeable population of European public workers live there.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The campus of the University of Alicante lies in San Vicente del Raspeig, bordering the city of Alicante to the north.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>More than 25,000 students attend the university.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Between 2005 and 2012 Ciudad de la Luz (Ciutat de la Llum), one of the largest film studios in Europe, had its base in Alicante.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The studio shot Spanish and international movies such as Asterix at the Olympic Games by Frédéric Forestier and Thomas Langmann, and Manolete by Menno Meyjes.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>It was shut down in 2012 for violating European competition law.</h4>
    </li>

    <h3>The area around Alicante has been inhabited for over 7000 years.</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><h4>The first tribes of hunter-gatherers moved down gradually from Central Europe between 5000 and 3000 BC.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Some of the earliest settlements were made on the slopes of Mount Benacantil.</h4>
    </li>
    <li> <h4>By 1000 BC Greek and Phoenician traders had begun to visit the eastern coast of Spain, establishing small trading ports and introducing the native Iberian tribes to the alphabet, iron, and the pottery wheel.</h4>
    </li>
    <li> <h4>The Carthaginian general Hamilcar Barca established the fortified settlement of Akra Leuké, meaning "White Mountain" or "White Point", in the mid-230s BC, which is generally presumed to have been on the site of modern Alicante.</h4>

    <h3>Geography</h3>
    <ul>
    <li><h4> Alicante is located in the southeast of the Iberian Peninsula, on the shores of the Mediterranean Sea.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Some orographic features rise over the largely flat terrain where the city is built on including the Cabo de la Huerta, the Serra Grossa, the Tosal and the Benacantil hills.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Located in an arid territory, Alicante lacks any meaningful permanent water stream.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>There are however several stream beds correspondent to intermittent ramblas.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>There was a swamp area in the northeast of the municipality, l'Albufereta, yet it was dried up in 1928.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The municipality has two exclaves in the mainland: Monnegre (between the municipalities of San Vicente del Raspeig, Mutxamel, Busot and Jijona), and Cabeçó d'Or; the latter comprises part of the namesake Cabeçó d'Or mountain (including the summit, 1209 metres above sea level).</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The small island of Tabarca, 8 nautical miles to the south of the city, also belongs to the municipality.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The foot of the main staircase of the City Hall Building (Ayuntamiento) is the zero point (cota cero), used as the point of reference for measuring the height above or below sea level of any point in Spain, due to the marginal tidal variations of the Mediterranean sea at Alicante.</h4>
    </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Economy </h3>
    <ul>
    <li><h4>Until the global recession which started in 2008, Alicante was one of the fastest-growing cities in Spain.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The boom depended partly on tourism directed to the beaches of the Costa Blanca and particularly on the second residence-construction boom which started in the 1960s and revived again by the late 1990s.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Services and public administration also play a major role in the city's economy.</h4>
    </li> 
    <li><h4>The construction boom has raised many environmental concerns and both the local autonomous government and city council are under scrutiny by the European Union.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The construction surge was the subject of hot debates among politicians and citizens alike.</h4>
    </li> 
    <li><h4> The latest of many public battles concerns the plans of the Port Authority of Alicante to construct an industrial estate on reclaimed land in front of the city's coastal strip, in breach of local, national, and European regulations.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>See Port of Alicante for details.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4> Ciudad de la Luz. The city serves as the headquarters of the European Union Intellectual Property Office and a sizeable population of European public workers live there.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The campus of the University of Alicante lies in San Vicente del Raspeig, bordering the city of Alicante to the north.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>More than 25,000 students attend the university.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>Between 2005 and 2012 Ciudad de la Luz (Ciutat de la Llum), one of the largest film studios in Europe, had its base in Alicante.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>The studio shot Spanish and international movies such as Asterix at the Olympic Games by Frédéric Forestier and Thomas Langmann, and Manolete by Menno Meyjes.</h4>
    </li>
    <li><h4>It was shut down in 2012 for violating European competition law.</h4>

           <h4>Santa Bárbara Castle (Valencian: Castell de Santa Bàrbara, Spanish: Castillo de Santa Bárbara) is a fortification in the center of Alicante, Spain.</h4>
           <h4>It stands on Mount Benacantil (166 m).</h4>
           <h4>Bronze Age, Iberian, and Roman artifacts have been found on the slopes of the mountain, but the origins of the castle date to the 9th century at the time of Muslim control of the Iberian Peninsula, from 711 till 1296.</h4>
           <h4>The Arab medieval geographer Al-Idrisi calls this mountain Banu-lQatil, and the toponym may derive from the words pinna (Arabic for "peak") and laqanti, adjectival form of Laqant, the Arabic name for Alicante.</h4>
           <h4>On 4 December 1248, the castle was captured by Castilian forces led by Alfonso of Castile.</h4>
           <h4>It was named after Saint Barbara, on whose feast day the castle was recaptured from the Arabs.</h4>
           <h4>It was conquered by the Aragonese in 1296 during the reign of James II of Aragon, who ordered its reconstruction.</h4>
           <h4>Peter IV of Aragon, Charles I of Spain and Philip II of Spain would oversee further reconstructions.</h4>
           <h4>The castle was bombarded in 1691 by a French squadron.</h4>
           <h4>During the War of the Spanish Succession, it was held by the British for three years.</h4> 
           <h4>In 1873, it was bombarded, along with the city, by the cantonalistas from the frigate Numancia.</h4>

            <h4>The floor is decorated with 6.600.000 tricolour marble tiles forming a design with a characteristic wave effect mosaic.</h4>
            <h4>During the summer season it houses the Alicante Craft Fair where you can buy typical products (sweets and nougat), leather crafts, glass, clothing and everything you can imagine.</h4>
            <h4>Throughout the year, it also hosts the traditional ‘hippie’ stalls, where you can buy souvenirs from Alicante, jewellery, fashion accessories, t-shirts and all kinds of items.</h4>

            <h4>Built by J. Vidal Ramos between 1922 and 1925, Casa Carbonell is said to have been constructed upon the orders of a textiles manufacturer from the nearby town of Alcoy, Enrique Carbonell.</h4>
            <h4>The building bears testimony to the wealth of Alcoy textiles manufacturers during World War One.</h4>

            <h4>The Co-cathedral of Saint Nicholas of Bari (Valencian: Cocatedral de Sant Nicolau de Bari, Spanish: Concatedral de San Nicolás de Bari) is a Roman Catholic co-cathedral located in Alacant, in the Valencian Community of Spain.</h4>
            <h4>The church, part of the Diocese of Orihuela-Alicante is dedicated to Saint Nicholas and was elevated to the title of cathedral on 9 March 1959 by Pope John XXIII.</h4>
            <h4>This church was built between 1613 and 1662.</h4>
            <h4>It was designed between 1610 and 1615 by Agustín Bernardino, a student of Juan de Herrera, and was constructed over an ancient mosque.</h4>
            <h4>The older cloister was built originally in the 15th century in Valencian Gothic style.</h4>
            <h4>The cathedral has a Latin cross plan, though the transepts are quite short.</h4>
            <h4>Flanking the nave are six interconnecting side chapels and an ambulatory around the apse. A blue dome rises 45 meters above the crossing.</h4>
            <h4>The chapel of Holy Communion, configured as a small Greek cross-planned temple, is considered to be one of the most beautiful examples of the Spanish Baroque.</h4>
            <h4>The external appearance of the cathedral is quite sober.</h4>
            <h4>The main facade located on the east side is of the Doric order, and the one built on the south side is of Ionic order.</h4>
